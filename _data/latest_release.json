  "body": "* **NEW:** Support for persistent `data-turbo-permanent` elements during Turbo Frames navigation. [#64, #71]\r\n* **NEW:** Support for `<form enctype>` and URL-encoded form submissions. [#76, #128]\r\n* **CHANGED:** Top-level `<form action=\"get\">` submissions now become Turbo Drive visits. That means they'll dispatch [visit events](https://turbo.hotwire.dev/reference/events) like `turbo:before-visit` and `turbo:visit`, but _not_ the `turbo:submit-start` or `turbo:submit-end` events.  [#126, #127]\r\n* **FIXED:** Successive `<form action=\"get\">` submissions to the current location no longer accumulate redundant query parameters. [#107, #108]\r\n* **FIXED:** The Turbo Streams `Accept:` header is only present for non-idempotent form submissions. [#52, #139]\r\n* **INTERNAL:** Development builds have moved to the new [hotwired/dev-builds](https://github.com/hotwired/dev-builds/releases) repository shared with Stimulus.\r\n* **INTERNAL:** The `Location` class has been replaced by the DOM URL API. [#90]\r\n* **INTERNAL:** The page and frame rendering systems have been unified, and rendering is now asynchronous. [#133]\r\n"
