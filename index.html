title: The speed of a single-page web application without having to write any JavaScript.
description: >-
  Turbo accelerates links and form submissions without requiring you to change your server-side generated HTML.
  It lets you carve up a page into independent frames, which can be lazy-loaded and operate as independent components.
  And finally, helps you make partial page updates using just HTML and a set of CRUD-like container tags.
  These three techniques reduce the amount of custom JavaScript that many web applications need to write by an order of magnitude.

  <strong>Turbo</strong> uses several complimenting techniques to dramatically reduce the amount of custom JavaScript that most web applications will need to write:
</p>

<ul class="lede">
  <li><em>Turbo Drive</em> accelerates links and form submissions by negating the need for full page reloads.</li>
  <li style="margin-top: 20px"><em>Turbo Frames</em> break down pages into independent contexts, which can be lazy-loaded and run as independent components.
  <li style="margin-top: 20px"><em>Turbo Updates</em> make partial page updates in response to form submissions and WebSocket messages, using just HTML and a set of CRUD-like container tags.</li>
</ul>

<p class="lede">
  It's all done by sending plain HTML over the wire. And for those instances when that's not enough, you can reach for the other side of <a href="https://hotwire.dev">Hotwire</a>, and finish the job with <a href="https://stimulusjs.org">Stimulus</a>.
