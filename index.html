title: The speed of a single-page web application without having to write any JavaScript.
description: >-
  Turbo accelerates links and form submissions without requiring you to change your server-side generated HTML.
  It lets you carve up a page into independent frames, which can be lazy-loaded and operate as independent components.
  And finally, helps you make partial page updates using just HTML and a set of CRUD-like container tags.
  These three techniques reduce the amount of custom JavaScript that many web applications need to write by an order of magnitude.
